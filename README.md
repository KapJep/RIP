Find out which Actors have left this world!

## Installation

Before you can run this project you need to get an api key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and put it in the `public/js/the_config.js` file.
Inside the folder `public/js/` you can find a file called `the_config.js.example` which you can use as a template.
Just rename it to `the_config.js` and put your api key in the `api_key` variable.
